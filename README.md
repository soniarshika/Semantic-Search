# Semantic search

## Introduction
This Semantic Search project is designed to facilitate efficient document retrieval based on semantic similarity. It leverages cutting-edge technologies such as FastAPI for REST API development, Qdrant for vector search, Sentence Transformers for generating semantic embeddings, and Langchain for document loading and processing.

## How to use?

A demonstration of Docker to implement a simple 2 tier architecture frontend will be able to access the backend
To start the entire environment, you can use the following command in the directory containing your Docker Compose file:

```sudo docker-compose up```

at the command prompt. 

## Directory Structure

frontend/: Contains the source code for the frontend application.
backend/: Contains the source code for the backend application.
docker-compose.yml: Builds a containerised application for end to end workflow.
